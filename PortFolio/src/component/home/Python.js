    <p className='my-2'>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
